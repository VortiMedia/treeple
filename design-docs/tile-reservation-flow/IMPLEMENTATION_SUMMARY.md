# Tile Reservation Flow - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

All components for the complete Tile Reservation Flow have been successfully implemented and tested.

---

## üì¶ Components Created

### 1. Authentication System
**Location:** `src/lib/auth-context.tsx`
- Mock authentication context using React Context API
- Persists user state in localStorage (MVP only)
- Functions: `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`
- Simulates network delay for realistic UX

**Location:** `src/components/auth/AuthDialog.tsx`
- Main authentication modal with tab switcher
- Supports Sign In / Sign Up flows
- Glassomorphism styling with backdrop blur

**Location:** `src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx`
- Email/password form with validation
- Uses `react-hook-form` + `zod` for validation
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications on success/error

**Location:** `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx`
- Registration form with name, email, password, confirm password
- Password matching validation
- Same validation and UX patterns as sign-in

### 2. Reservation Dialog
**Location:** `src/components/tiles/ReservationDialog.tsx`
- Confirmation modal for authenticated users
- Displays tile summary card with:
  - Tile ID and status badge
  - Coordinates and price
  - Area information
- Optional gift message input (max 200 chars)
- Simulates reservation with loading state
- Success toast with confirmation message

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
**Location:** `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx` (modified)
- Account dropdown for authenticated users:
  - Avatar with user initials
  - Profile link
  - My Tiles link
  - Sign Out option
- Sign In button for unauthenticated users
- Opens AuthDialog on Sign In click
- Forest green accent color (#4f872b)

### 4. Tile Actions Integration
**Location:** `src/components/tiles/TileActions.tsx` (modified)
- Checks auth state before reservation
- Opens AuthDialog if not authenticated
- Opens ReservationDialog if authenticated
- Maintains existing button styling and structure

### 5. Root Layout Update
**Location:** `app/layout.tsx` (modified)
- Wrapped app with `<AuthProvider>`
- Added Sonner `<Toaster>` component
- Positioned toasts at top-center with rich colors

### 6. Type Definitions
**Location:** `src/types/index.ts` (modified)
- Added `User` interface (email, name)
- Added `AuthContextType` interface

## üé® Design System Implementation

### Colors
- **Primary Green:** `#4f872b` (forest conservation theme)
- **Hover Green:** `#3d6821`
- **Status Colors:**
  - Available: `emerald-500`
  - Reserved: `amber-500`
  - Sold: `slate-500`

### Glassomorphism Effects
- `backdrop-blur-xl bg-white/95`
- Large border radius: `rounded-2xl`
- Subtle shadows and borders

### Components Styling
- All buttons use forest green for primary actions
- Avatar fallbacks use green background with white text
- Toast notifications use rich colors for better visibility
- Forms have inline error messages below fields

## üîÑ User Flows Implemented

### Unauthenticated User Flow
1. User lands on map page ‚Üí sees "Sign In" button in navigation
2. User clicks available tile ‚Üí SidePanel opens with tile details
3. User clicks "Reserve This Square" ‚Üí AuthDialog opens
4. User can toggle between Sign In / Sign Up tabs
5. User enters credentials and submits
6. On success ‚Üí Dialog closes, toast appears, navigation shows avatar
7. User can now click "Reserve This Square" again ‚Üí ReservationDialog opens
8. User confirms reservation ‚Üí Success toast, dialog closes

### Authenticated User Flow
1. User sees avatar with initials in navigation
2. User can access dropdown menu:
   - Profile
   - My Tiles
   - Sign Out
3. User clicks available tile ‚Üí SidePanel opens
4. User clicks "Reserve This Square" ‚Üí ReservationDialog opens immediately
5. User reviews tile details, optionally adds gift message
6. User clicks "Reserve for $50" ‚Üí Loading state, then success
7. Toast notification confirms reservation
8. Dialog closes

## üìã Technical Details

### Dependencies Installed
```bash
# shadcn/ui components
card, badge, dialog, separator, dropdown-menu, input, avatar, label, form, sonner

# Form validation
react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod
```

### Key Patterns Used
- **Client Components:** All interactive components use `'use client'` directive
- **React Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useForm`
- **Async Simulation:** Uses `setTimeout` to simulate API calls
- **Toast Feedback:** Success/error states communicated via Sonner toasts
- **Conditional Rendering:** Auth state determines which UI to show

### Performance Considerations
- Auth state loaded from localStorage on mount
- Lazy loading of dialogs (only render when open)
- Minimal re-renders with proper dependency arrays
- Build completes successfully with zero errors

## üéØ MVP Status: Complete

All required features for the Tile Reservation Flow MVP have been implemented:

‚úÖ Mock authentication (sign in, sign up, sign out)
‚úÖ Auth state persistence (localStorage)
‚úÖ Navigation with account dropdown
‚úÖ Authentication dialogs with form validation
‚úÖ Reservation confirmation dialog
‚úÖ Toast notifications
‚úÖ Tile action integration with auth checks

## üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 2 - Out of Scope for Current MVP)

- Real backend authentication (Supabase)
- Stripe payment integration
- Actual tile reservation persistence
- Email notifications
- Certificate generation
- My Tiles dashboard page
- Profile management page

## üìù Demo Notes

For investor demos, use these credentials:
- **Email:** Any valid email format (e.g., demo@treeple.com)
- **Password:** Any password with 8+ characters (e.g., password123)

The mock authentication accepts any credentials for demo purposes. All reservations are simulated and not persisted to a backend.
