- Build investor confidence in the platform's multi-area potential

### Success Metrics (MVP)
- Interactive demo runs smoothly on desktop and mobile
- Map loads in < 2 seconds
- Grid overlay renders 1000+ tiles without performance issues
- Investors can visualize the full user journey (browse â†’ select â†’ reserve)
- UI feels premium, modern, and trustworthy

## 5. Data Structure

### Tile Object
```json
{
  "id": "YS-001-045",
  "coordinates": {
    "lat": 44.5678,
    "lng": -110.1234
  },
  "status": "available", // available | reserved | sold
  "geometry": { /* GeoJSON polygon */ },
  "reservedAt": null, // ISO timestamp
  "soldAt": null
}
```

### Grid Generation
- Use Turf.js `squareGrid` function
- Bounding box: Yellowstone National Park boundaries
- Cell size: 1 km
- Output: GeoJSON FeatureCollection
- Store in: `public/data/yellowstone-grid.json`

---

## 6. Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
```
Next.js 14 (App Router)
â”œâ”€â”€ React 18
â”œâ”€â”€ TypeScript
â”œâ”€â”€ Tailwind CSS
â”œâ”€â”€ shadcn/ui
â””â”€â”€ MapLibre GL JS
```

### Key Libraries
- `maplibre-gl` - Map rendering
- `@turf/turf` - Geospatial calculations
- `@maptiler/sdk` - MapTiler integration
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `clsx` / `tailwind-merge` - Utility styling

### File Structure
```
treeple/
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # All documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data/          # Implementation-specific GeoJSON data
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/           # Next.js pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/           # Utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/         # TypeScript types
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ constants/     # Config constants
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

**Note:** The platform is designed to be implementation-agnostic. Grid data and configuration can be swapped out for different conservation areas in future deployments.

## 7. User Flow (MVP Demo)

### Happy Path
1. User lands on homepage
2. Map loads with Yellowstone centered
3. User zooms into an area of interest
4. User hovers over a green (available) square â†’ highlight appears
5. User clicks the square
6. Side panel slides in with:
   - Tile ID: "YS-001-045"
   - Status badge: "Available"
   - Coordinates
   - "Reserve This Square" button
7. User clicks "Reserve This Square"
8. (MVP: Show success message, no real transaction)

### Edge Cases
- Clicking a sold tile â†’ Panel shows "Sold Out", no CTA
- Clicking a reserved tile â†’ Panel shows "Reserved", grayed CTA
- Slow network â†’ Show loading skeleton
- Mobile view â†’ Panel slides from bottom, full-width

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Grid size:** Is 1km too large? Should we use 0.5km for more granularity?
2. **Pricing:** What's the price point per square? ($25, $50, $100?)
3. **Real vs symbolic:** How do we communicate this is symbolic, not actual land ownership?
4. **Conservation partner:** Which Yellowstone foundation to partner with?
