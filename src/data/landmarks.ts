    description: "World's most famous geyser",
    bio: "Old Faithful is a cone geyser in Yellowstone National Park. It was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to be named. It is one of the most predictable geographical features on Earth, erupting almost every 90 minutes. The geyser, along with the rest of the Yellowstone National Park, is managed by the National Park Service.",

    description: "Largest hot spring in the United States",
    bio: "The Grand Prismatic Spring is the largest hot spring in the United States, and the third largest in the world. It is located in the Midway Geyser Basin. The vivid colors in the spring are the result of microbial mats around the edges of the mineral-rich water. The deep blue color of the water in the center is due to the intrinsic blue color of water, which is a result of water's selective absorption of red wavelengths of visible light.",

    bio: "Mammoth Hot Springs is a large complex of hot springs on a hill of travertine. The travertine terraces are created when water from the underground hot springs cools and deposits calcium carbonate. The terraces grow at a rate of up to 8 inches per year, creating an ever-changing landscape. The area has been used by Native Americans for thousands of years and was the first headquarters of Yellowstone National Park.",

Steamboat Geyser, located in Norris, is the world's tallest active geyser, capable of shooting water over 300 feet in the air during major eruptions. The basin sits at the intersection of multiple fault lines, contributing to its dynamic and unpredictable nature.",

This thermal area features hot springs, geysers, and mud pots that extend right into the cold waters of the lake. The basin was formed by a volcanic eruption about 174,000 years ago, creating a small caldera within the larger Yellowstone caldera. It's one of the most scenic thermal areas in the park.",

    bio: "The Mud Volcano area features some of the most acidic thermal features in Yellowstone. Dragon's Mouth Spring and Mud Volcano itself create an otherworldly landscape of bubbling mud pots and steaming vents. The area's high acidity is due to hydrogen sulfide gas dissolving in water to form sulfuric acid, which breaks down the surrounding rock into clay.",
